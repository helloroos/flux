# Flux

Flux is a travel planner that solves two common trip challenges; the dates and the destination. Users can initiate a travel plan and invite participants to join. Collaborators can nominate suggestions and upvote, downvote and comment on othersâ€™ suggestions. 

Demo Flux [here](https://state-of-flux.herokuapp.com/).

## Architecture and Technology

Flux is built using the MERN stack which consists of MongoDB Atlas as a NoSQL database, Express.js as a framework for Node.js, and React/Redux for state management. A Gmail API is used to interact with users' Gmail inboxes. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can install dependencies by running:

```sh
npm install
```

Start the server by running:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
